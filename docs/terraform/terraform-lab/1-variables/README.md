# 1. Variables

## 코드 작성

### 파일 구조

이 실습 예제는 총 4개의 `.tf` 파일로 구성됩니다.

```bash
./
├── instance.tf   # EC2 정보
├── variables.tf  # AMI ID, Region 변수
├── provider.tf   # AWS Region 선언
└── versions.tf   # 버전 정보
```

### instance.tf

```json
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = lookup(var.AMIS, var.AWS_REGION, "") # last parameter is the default value
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
}
```

### variables.tf

```json
variable "AWS_REGION" {
  default = "ap-northeast-2"
}

variable "AMIS" {
  type = map(string)

  # [Tips]
  # AMI ID `ami-0cbec04a61be382d9` means
  # Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM) - Kernel 5.10
  # SSD Volume Type on ap-northeast-2.
  default = {
    ap-northeast-2 = "ami-0cbec04a61be382d9"
  }
}
```

### provider.tf

```json
provider "aws" {
  region = var.AWS_REGION
}
```

### versions.tf

```json
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 0.12"
}
```

## init, plan, apply

```bash
$ terraform init
```

생성될 리소스 정보를 미리 확인합니다.

```bash
$ terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following
execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the
following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

방금 생성된 EC2 인스턴스는 잠시 기다리면 Running 상태로 변경됩니다.

## destroy

비용 청구되는 일을 방지하기 위해 테라폼으로 생성한 리소스를 제거합니다.

```bash
$ terraform destroy
